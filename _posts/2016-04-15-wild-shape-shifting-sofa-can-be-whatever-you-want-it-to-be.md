  Carlo Ratti, who founded MIT's forward-thinking Senseable City Lab, has
  designed a sofa called Lift-Bit. It is on display at La Triennale in Milan,
  where innumerable furniture-makers showcase their work in an annual design
  fair. Sofas (and chairs, for that matter) at Salone del Mobile are like fish
  in an aquarium: plentiful and beautiful, but, after a while, hard to discern.
